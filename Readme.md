Use-a-Story is an educational board game that I designed for my master's thesis. Essentially, it is an adaptation of [Gartic Phone](https://garticphone.com) and [Mutabo](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/238094/mutabo) where the initial prompts are always user stories. This repository contains the user stories we used.

We designed this game to be played in groups of six. As every player gets to draw or write simultaneously, we came up with six user stories as prompts. These are:

- As a musician, I want my sheet music stand to have integrated clamps so that my sheet music does not fall off.
- As a boulderer, I want the walls to be sticky so that I don't fall off so easily.
- As a fairy, I want a tree house so that I can invite my friends over.
- As a beaver, I want trees along the river so that I have enough material to build a dam.
- As a carpenter, I want to have a quick delivery of wood so that I can fulfill all my projects without waiting for material.
- As a bus driver, I want a massage chair so that I can relax in between trips.

These are each printed on DIN A5 paper. Six more blank DIN A5 sheets are then stapled to the back of the sheet with the user story. With that, the game can start.
